        {}
        {\begin{itemize}
        \item Engineered highly \textbf{scalable designs for the pricing module, order matching, and order processing modules}. These designs were meticulously crafted to \textbf{handle increased workloads} and ensure seamless performance under high demand scenarios.
        \item Excelled in the pricing module of the equity product, flawlessly managing a staggering workload of over \textbf{500,000 ticks per minute} from exchange via socket connections, processing them with a capacity of \textbf{100,000 ticks per minute} on a single pod. Seamlessly orchestrated the pricing pipeline, maintaining an exceptional end-to-end latency of under \textbf{60 ms}. This encompassed the swift handling of price ticks from reception to consumption by user's socket connections on app, as well as seamless integration with internal matching and portfolio services.
        \item Enhanced the order processing module, achieving a remarkable capability of processing up to 20,000 orders per minute on a single pod.
